In this software tools and database project, I utilized Java along with the JDBC driver for communication with a MySQL database. The main focus was on creating a robust and efficient database system. For designing the database schema, I employed Erwin, a powerful tool that facilitates the visual modeling of database structures, ensuring a clear and well-organized database architecture.

The project also involved the implementation of various algorithms to address specific challenges. For instance, Dijkstra's algorithm, a widely used graph algorithm, was incorporated. This algorithm plays a crucial role in optimizing paths within the database, contributing to efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

Overall, the project seamlessly integrates Java and MySQL, leveraging the JDBC driver for smooth communication.
